My name is Ashlyn and I am a senior specializing in food and bioprocessing. Once I graduate, I am moving to Owensboro, KY to work at The Glenmore Distillery as a manufacturing intern. I have a cat named Squid who I love very much and am getting my first dog this summer. In my free time, I like to paint, knit, ski, and play video games.
